# Gauss Elimination Solver

A simple Java implementation of the **Gauss Elimination** method for solving systems of linear equations. The program takes a system of equations represented as an augmented matrix and applies the Gaussian elimination algorithm to compute the solution vector.

## Features
- Solves systems of linear equations using the Gauss elimination method (without partial pivoting).
- Supports any square matrix size (n x n).
- Command-line input for easy testing with custom matrices.
- Displays intermediate steps and the final solution for transparency and debugging.

## Technologies
- **Java SE** – core language used for implementation
- **Java Collections** – basic use of arrays for matrix representation

## About
This project was created to demonstrate the implementation of a classic numerical method used in linear algebra and scientific computing. It was developed as part of my academic learning focused on numerical algorithms.
